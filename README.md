# techradar-weblab
 Project for course week WEBLAB


### How To Run
There are 2 ways to run.

For local dev
1. npm run watch in \expressJs ---> this will start the back end on localhost 3001
2. npm run watch in \expressJs\react ----> this will start the frontend in dev mode (meaning it sends backend requests to 3001)


For prod
1. Build react project --> this will cause a prod build (which means react project wont show to localhost but to the google cloud)
2. Deploy or run core project
